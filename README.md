Friendly trading

## What is Frade ?

Frade is a community app designed to allow its user to invest into cryptocurrency trading without having to learn anything about trading or cryptocurrencies.

It is like an investment fund based on cryptocurrencies.

## Why is Frade different than other trading applications ?

Frade is based on its own token (FradeCoin) and it does not charge you unless you make some money.

You only pay a percentage of your benefit. If a position make no benefit you won't be charged of any fee.

User also pay a little fee when they sell their coin to the application. Exchanging FradeCoin with other users is free of fee and totally approved by the application

## How does Frade work

A user can buy some FradeCoin, the value of the coin is related to the current amount of money the application has available.

The only place you can buy new FradeCoins is on the platform. User may trade FradeCoins through different wallet but there is no mining.
New FradeCoins imply investing more money on the application.

The user can decide how many coin he wants to borrow to the application for trading. The more coin he borrows the smaller the fees.

Every positions took by the application is public for every users.
The user can check the performance of the trading bots in their dashboard.

Once the user gave coins to the application to trade, the coins are placed on several tokens using different trading strategy to avoid losing it all at once if one bot has a loss position.

The more successful the application is, the more expensive the coin get so the point is to make user get the most beneficial positions. Each threshold value reached by the coin will impact the fees. It would not be fair to charge user with the same amount of coins if the value raises.
